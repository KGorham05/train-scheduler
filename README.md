# Train Scheduler

## Firebase project

The **purpose** of this project is to practice interacting with firebase and the moment.js API.
This page can be used to calculate the time until a particular train arrives.  

**Firebase** was used to practice interacting with a server side database, and **moment.js** was used to calculate train times using the current time.

**Get started** by clicking adding a train of your own. Then reload the page to see the data persist! 

The **github** for this project can be found here: [Github](https://github.com/KGorham05/train-scheduler)

This project was created and is maintained by **Kevin Gorham**.
